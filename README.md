# Retail-Neural-Network-Model-
Developed a NNM to predict order priority using metrics including shipping cost, sales, quantity, discount, and profit.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the supply chain in our superstore by identifying the key factors influencing order priority. 
We aim to achieve this by developing neural network models to predict order priorities accurately, enabling us to optimize inventory management and ensure timely delivery of products for the retail business.
